# Surah-Guess
I write a program called The Surahs in the Quran where players need to know the sequence numbers of each of the 114 surahs in the Quran.
The name of surah appears one by one randomly. 
For example one surah name randomly appears: ""AL- Maidah"",  the player must correctly entered the number 5.
The program will respond with CORRECT or WRONG after the player entered the answer.
A surah that has been correctly numbered will be taken out of the and will not be displayed again.
The game terminates when the user made 3 wrong answers OR when the player has answered ALL of the surah numbers correctly.
